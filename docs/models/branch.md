## Fields

### Name

The branch's unique name.

### Owner

The NetBox user who created the branch.

### Schema ID

The unique, randomly-generated identifier of the PostgreSQL schema which houses the branch in the database.

### Status

The current status of the branch. This must be one of the following values.

| Status       | Description                                                       |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| New          | Not yet provisioned in the database                               |
| Provisioning | A job is running to provision the branch's PostgreSQL schema      |
| Ready        | The branch is healthy and ready to be synchronized or merged      |
| Syncing      | A job is running to synchronize changes from main into the branch |
| Merging      | A job is running to merge changes from the branch into main       |
| Reverting    | A job is running to revert previously merged changes in main      |
| Merged       | Changes from this branch have been successfully merged into main  |
| Archived     | A merged branch which has been deprovisioned in the database      |
| Failed       | Provisioning the schema for this branch has failed                |

### Last Sync

The time at which this branch was most recently synchronized with main. This value will be null if the branch has never been synchronized.

!!! tip
    Reference the `synced_time` attribute on a branch to return either the branch's `last_sync` time or, if null, its creation time.

### Merged Time

The time at which the branch was merged into main. This value will be null if the branch has not been merged.

### Merged By

The NetBox user who merged the branch. This value will be null if the branch has not been merged.
