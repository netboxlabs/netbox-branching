# AGENTS.md — netbox-branching

## Repository Overview

`netbox-branching` is a NetBox plugin that adds git-like branching to the network source-of-truth platform. Each branch is an isolated PostgreSQL schema copy of the database; users make changes within a branch and merge back to the main schema. It is owned by NetBox Labs and runs inside NetBox as a Django app (`netbox_branching`, mounted at `/branching/`). Requires PostgreSQL (schema isolation), Redis (background jobs), and NetBox 4.4.1+. The currently supported NetBox version range is in `COMPATIBILITY.md` (4.4.1 – 4.6.x at the time of writing).

## Tech Stack

- Python (defer to `pyproject.toml`; currently `>=3.10`)
- NetBox (host app — minimum and maximum versions are pinned in `netbox_branching/__init__.py` `min_version` / `max_version`; `COMPATIBILITY.md` summarises the matrix)
- Django + Django REST Framework (NetBox's foundations)
- PostgreSQL (required — branch isolation depends on schema-level separation)
- Redis (required — background jobs use NetBox's job queue)
- Django's built-in test runner (`django.test.TestCase`-based, run via `manage.py test`)
- ruff for lint + format (config in `ruff.toml`)
- mkdocs + mkdocs-material for user-facing docs

Defer all version pins to `pyproject.toml` and `netbox_branching/__init__.py`.

## Architecture

### Database Isolation

The core mechanism uses PostgreSQL schemas. Each branch gets its own schema (e.g. `branch_abc123`). Two custom components make this work:

- **`DynamicSchemaDict`** (`utilities.py`): A `dict` subclass wrapping `DATABASES`. When Django looks up a `schema_<id>` database alias, it returns the standard DB config with a modified `search_path` pointing to that branch's schema — without requiring pre-registration of every alias.
- **`BranchAwareRouter`** (`database.py`): A Django database router that intercepts all queries, checks the current `active_branch` context variable, and routes to the appropriate schema alias.

Both must be configured in the host NetBox instance (`DATABASES = DynamicSchemaDict(...)` and `DATABASE_ROUTERS` containing `BranchAwareRouter`). The plugin validates these in `AppConfig.ready()` and raises `ImproperlyConfigured` if either is missing.

### Context Management

- `contextvars.py`: Holds `active_branch` as a `ContextVar` — propagates through async code automatically.
- `middleware.py`: `BranchMiddleware` reads the active branch from cookies/query params and sets the context variable for each request, then restores it on teardown.
- `utilities.py`: `activate_branch()` / `deactivate_branch()` provide programmatic context switching used by jobs and tests.

### Branch Lifecycle

```
NEW → PROVISIONING → READY → (SYNCING / MIGRATING / MERGING / REVERTING) → MERGED or ARCHIVED
```

Transitional statuses (`PROVISIONING`, `SYNCING`, `MIGRATING`, `MERGING`, `REVERTING`) indicate a background job is in progress. `PENDING_MIGRATIONS` and `FAILED` are additional terminal-adjacent states.

Branch operations run as background jobs in `jobs.py`:

| Job class | Operation |
|---|---|
| `ProvisionBranchJob` | Create the schema and copy the database |
| `SyncBranchJob` | Pull changes from main into the branch |
| `MergeBranchJob` | Apply branch changes to main |
| `RevertBranchJob` | Undo a merged branch's changes |
| `MigrateBranchJob` | Apply outstanding Django migrations to the branch schema |

### Merge Strategies (`merge_strategies/`)

Pluggable strategy pattern with an abstract base in `strategy.py`. Selected per-branch via `Branch.merge_strategy`:

- **`IterativeMergeStrategy`** (default): Replays `ObjectChange` log entries in chronological order, one at a time.
- **`SquashMergeStrategy`**: Collapses all per-object changes into a single create/update/delete operation before applying. Handles dependency ordering via `CollapsedChange`.

Both strategies work by replaying NetBox's built-in `ObjectChange` audit trail. The abstract base provides `_clean()` post-merge cleanup; subclasses implement `merge()` and `revert()`.

### Change Tracking (`models/changes.py`)

- **`ObjectChange`** — Proxy of NetBox's built-in `ObjectChange` model. Adds `apply()`, `undo()`, and `migrate()` methods used by merge strategies.
- **`ChangeDiff`** — Tracks per-object diffs between a branch and main. Used for conflict detection: a conflict exists when the same object is modified in both main and the branch since the last sync.
- **`AppliedChange`** — Records which changes have been applied to branch schemas, enabling idempotent sync/migrate operations.

### Signals (`signals.py`)

The plugin exposes pre/post signals for every branch lifecycle operation, enabling integration by third-party code:

`pre_provision` / `post_provision`, `pre_deprovision` / `post_deprovision`, `pre_sync` / `post_sync`, `pre_migrate` / `post_migrate`, `pre_merge` / `post_merge`, `pre_revert` / `post_revert`

### Branch Action Validators

Callable validators can be registered for each action (`sync`, `merge`, `migrate`, `revert`, `archive`) via `PLUGINS_CONFIG`. These are loaded in `AppConfig.ready()` via `Branch.register_preaction_check()` and called before the corresponding job is enqueued. See `docs/plugin-development.md` for the validator signature.

## Commands

There is no Justfile/Makefile in this repo; commands are raw. Run them inside a NetBox checkout that has this plugin installed and `testing/configuration.py` linked in as `netbox/netbox/configuration.py`.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pip install -e '.[dev,test]'` (from this repo) | Install the plugin in editable mode with dev + test extras |
| `python netbox/manage.py test netbox_branching.tests --keepdb` | Run the full test suite |
| `python netbox/manage.py test netbox_branching.tests.test_branches --keepdb` | Run a single test module |
| `ruff check` | Lint |
| `python netbox/manage.py makemigrations netbox_branching` | Generate Django migrations after model changes |
| `python netbox/manage.py migrate` | Apply migrations |
| `python netbox/manage.py runserver` | Start NetBox locally with the plugin loaded |
| `mkdocs serve` | Preview the user docs |
| `mkdocs build` | Build static docs site |
| `python -m build` | Build sdist + wheel (matches the release workflow) |

## Development

NetBox plugins must run inside a NetBox checkout. The reproducible setup mirrors what CI does (`.github/workflows/lint-tests.yaml`):

1. Clone NetBox alongside this repo: `git clone https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox.git`
2. Symlink this repo's `testing/configuration.py` into NetBox: `ln -s "$PWD/nbl-netbox-branching/testing/configuration.py" netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py`
3. Install NetBox's requirements: `pip install -r netbox/requirements.txt`
4. Install this plugin in editable mode: `pip install -e '.[dev,test]'`
5. Provision PostgreSQL (`netbox` / `netbox` / `netbox`) and Redis on localhost (default ports)
6. Run migrations and start the dev server

The `testing/configuration.py` sets `PLUGINS = ['netbox_branching']`, configures `DATABASES` as a `DynamicSchemaDict`, and adds `BranchAwareRouter` to `DATABASE_ROUTERS`.

After model changes, generate a migration with `python netbox/manage.py makemigrations netbox_branching`.

## Testing

- Tests use `django.test.TestCase`, **not** pytest. Suites live in `netbox_branching/tests/`.
- Run via NetBox's test runner: `python netbox/manage.py test netbox_branching.tests --keepdb`. The `--keepdb` flag preserves the test database and branch schemas between runs, which is important for speed.
- The runner uses NetBox's settings and creates a real PostgreSQL test database — branch schema provisioning and teardown happen against a real database. Do not mock the database.
- Test modules:

| Module | Coverage area |
|---|---|
| `test_api.py` | REST API endpoints (CRUD, sync/merge/revert/migrate actions) |
| `test_branches.py` | Branch model operations and lifecycle |
| `test_changediff.py` | `ChangeDiff` conflict detection |
| `test_config.py` | Plugin configuration validation |
| `test_connection_lifecycle.py` | Database connection management |
| `test_events.py` | `BranchEvent` creation |
| `test_filtersets.py` | Filterset functionality |
| `test_iterative_merge.py` | Iterative merge strategy (comprehensive) |
| `test_query.py` | Branch-aware query routing |
| `test_related_models.py` | Related model handling across schemas |
| `test_request.py` | Request-level branch context |
| `test_squash_merge.py` | Squash merge strategy (comprehensive) |
| `test_sync.py` | Branch sync operations (comprehensive) |
| `test_views.py` | Web views |

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

- **`lint-tests.yaml`** — Runs on every PR. Two jobs:
  - *Linting*: Python 3.12, runs `ruff check` and `mkdocs build`.
  - *Tests*: Matrix of Python 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 against a configurable NetBox ref (defaults to `main`). Spins up PostgreSQL + Redis services, installs the plugin, links `testing/configuration.py`, and runs `python netbox/manage.py test netbox_branching.tests --keepdb`.
- **`release.yaml`** — Driven by pushing a `v*` tag, not by publishing a GitHub release, so pre-releases follow the same automated path as final releases. Builds sdist + wheel with `python -m build`, runs `twine check`, verifies the tag against the version declared in `pyproject.toml`, `AppConfig.version` and the wheel metadata (`scripts/verify_release_tag.py`), verifies the wheel's contents (`scripts/verify_wheel_contents.py`), rebuilds a wheel from the sdist, and smoke-tests a clean `--no-deps` install. Only then does it publish to PyPI using OIDC trusted publishing, and create the GitHub release (marked as a pre-release for any tag carrying a designation) if the tag doesn't already have one. Also runs — build and verification only, no publish — on pull requests that touch packaging inputs, which catches a version bump applied to only one of the two declaration sites. A `workflow_dispatch` from a `v*` tag publishes to Test PyPI instead, as an opt-in rehearsal.
- **`claude.yaml`** — Claude Code automation hook; triggers on issue/PR comments mentioning `@claude`.

## Common Tasks

### Add a new model

1. Add the model to `models/branches.py` or `models/changes.py` (or a new module imported from `models/__init__.py`). Use NetBox's `PrimaryModel` for full features or `BaseModel` for auxiliary tables.
2. Run `python netbox/manage.py makemigrations netbox_branching`.
3. Wire up the rest of the surface area: `filtersets.py`, `forms/model_forms.py`, `forms/filtersets.py`, `tables/tables.py`, `api/serializers.py`, `api/urls.py`, `urls.py`, `navigation.py`, and a per-model template under `templates/netbox_branching/`.
4. Register a `SearchIndex` in `search.py` if the model should appear in NetBox's global search.
5. Add tests covering model logic, API, filtersets, and views.

### Add a REST API endpoint

1. Add the serializer to `api/serializers.py` — `NetBoxModelSerializer` for `PrimaryModel`.
2. Add the viewset to `api/views.py`. For custom actions (sync, merge, etc.) use `@action(detail=True, methods=['post'])`.
3. Register the route in `api/urls.py` via the `NetBoxRouter`.
4. Ensure a corresponding `FilterSet` exists in `filtersets.py`; add explicit `<field>_id = ModelMultipleChoiceFilter(field_name='<field>', ...)` for FK filters.
5. Add an integration test in `tests/test_api.py`.

### Add a branch action validator

1. Write a callable with signature `def my_validator(branch, user, **kwargs)` that raises `ValidationError` to block the action.
2. Users configure it in `PLUGINS_CONFIG['netbox_branching']['<action>_validators'] = ['myapp.validators.my_validator']`.
3. The plugin loads and registers validators in `AppConfig.ready()` — no code changes required in the plugin itself.
4. Document the validator contract in `docs/plugin-development.md`.

### Bump the supported NetBox version

1. Update `min_version` / `max_version` in `netbox_branching/__init__.py`.
2. Update `COMPATIBILITY.md`.
3. Adjust the NetBox `ref` (or matrix) in `.github/workflows/lint-tests.yaml`.
4. Run the suite locally against the new version.
5. Note any compatibility changes or breaking changes in `docs/changelog.md`.

### Cut a release

1. Bump `version` in both `pyproject.toml` and `netbox_branching/__init__.py`. The two must agree — `release.yaml` fails the build if they don't, on release PRs as well as on the tag itself.
2. Update `docs/changelog.md`.
3. Push a `vX.Y.Z` tag. `release.yaml` builds, verifies, publishes to PyPI, and creates the GitHub release.

Tags must match `vX.Y.Z[-designation]`. The designation is what makes a pre-release, and it is compared after PEP 440 normalisation, so a beta is cut by setting the version to `1.3.0b1` in both files and pushing `v1.3.0-beta1`:

```
git tag v1.3.0-beta1 && git push origin v1.3.0-beta1
```

PyPI receives `1.3.0b1`, which `pip install netboxlabs-netbox-branching` skips unless the user opts in with `--pre` or pins the exact version, and the GitHub release is marked as a pre-release automatically.

To rehearse a publish without touching production PyPI, run the workflow manually (`workflow_dispatch`) against the tag; that route publishes to Test PyPI and requires a trusted publisher configured there for this project.

## Conventions and Patterns

- **Plugin code stays in the plugin package.** Don't monkey-patch NetBox.
- **Use NetBox's mixins and base classes** (`PrimaryModel`, `BaseModel`, `NetBoxModelSerializer`, `NetBoxModelFilterSet`) rather than re-implementing behaviour.
- **All UI views use `@register_model_view`** from `utilities.views`. All views live in `views.py`.
- **FK filters** must declare an explicit `<field>_id = ModelMultipleChoiceFilter(field_name='<field>', ...)` in the filterset; do not rely on `Meta.fields` to auto-generate `_id` variants.
- **Signal receivers** for Django ORM events (`post_save`, `pre_delete`, etc.) live in `signal_receivers.py` and are imported in `AppConfig.ready()`.
- **Branch operation signals** (pre/post lifecycle events) are defined in `signals.py` and documented for third-party use.
- **Cross-model UI extensions** live in `template_content.py`.
- **Search registration** lives in `search.py`.
- **Permissions** use NetBox's standard model permissions (`netbox_branching.view_branch`, etc.).
- **Exempt models.** Plugin models that should not be branched must be listed in `PLUGINS_CONFIG['netbox_branching']['exempt_models']`. Other plugin authors are responsible for configuring this for their own models.
- **Migrations.** No squashing has been done; migrations are sequential (0001–0008). Write data migrations using `apps.get_model(...)` and `get_or_create` — ContentType rows may not exist at migration time.
- **Connection cleanup.** Branch database aliases are dynamically created and not in `DATABASES.keys()`, so Django's built-in `close_old_connections()` misses them. `close_old_branch_connections()` in `utilities.py` is connected to `request_started`/`request_finished` signals to plug this leak (see issue #358).
- **Linting.** Config in `ruff.toml`. Enabled groups: `E1`–`E3`, `E501`, `W`, `I`, `RET`, `UP`. Line length 120, single quotes, LF endings, `preview = true`. Ignored: `F403`, `F405`, `RET504`, `TRY002`, `UP032`. `netbox_branching` is treated as first-party for import sorting.

## Troubleshooting

- **`DATABASES must be a DynamicSchemaDict instance`** — The host NetBox configuration has not wrapped `DATABASES` with `DynamicSchemaDict`. See the README installation instructions.
- **`DATABASE_ROUTERS must contain 'netbox_branching.database.BranchAwareRouter'`** — Add the router string to `DATABASE_ROUTERS` in the NetBox configuration.
- **Branch stuck in a transitional status** — A background job likely failed. Check the job log in the NetBox UI or database. The job timeout is configurable via `job_timeout` (default 3600 s).
- **Conflict detected on merge** — `ChangeDiff` found that the same object was modified in both main and the branch since the last sync. Sync the branch first to incorporate main's changes, then re-attempt the merge.
- **`PENDING_MIGRATIONS` status** — The branch schema is missing Django migrations that have been applied to main. Run `MigrateBranchJob` (or use the Migrate button in the UI) to apply them.
- **Tests fail with connection errors** — Ensure PostgreSQL and Redis are running and accessible. The test config in `testing/configuration.py` expects both on localhost default ports.
- **Branch connections leak over time** — Likely missing the `request_started`/`request_finished` signal hookup for `close_old_branch_connections`. This is registered automatically in `AppConfig.ready()`; confirm the plugin loaded correctly.
